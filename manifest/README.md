A list of my (current) values and the principles I would like to work by. Inspired by Allen Holub's [Heuristics for Effective Software Development](https://holub.com/heuristics-for-effective-software-development-a-continuously-evolving-list/)

## Product Management
-

## Teams and Peopleware
- [Value] Psychological safety
- [Value] Respect at all levels 
- [Value] Trust: we need to activelly put our trust in people to do what they have been hired to do and help them grow
- Blame culture is toxic and prevents progress (see _Psychological safety_). Everyone needs to assume their share of the responsibility when results are not the expected ones
- Do not aim to never fail, aim at recovering quickly from failures and LEARN in the process. Understand that nobody wants to fail, specially when they feel part of the team, the project and the strategic objectives. Manage risk

- Communication is key: non-violent open communication is one of most important elements of team success

## Software Development
- The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is still valid today:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

- Estimations are counter-productive, they are taken as promises by the client when they can never be right
- Trying to make better estimates is a fool's errand, which will take up time that could be used for doing something actually useful (that approaches you to an actual outcome)
