A list of my (current) values and the principles I would like to work by. Inspired by Allen Holub's [Heuristics for Effective Software Development](https://holub.com/heuristics-for-effective-software-development-a-continuously-evolving-list/)

## Product Management
-

## Teams and Peopleware
- Psychological safety, respect and trust
- 

## Software Development
- The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is still valid today:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

- Estimations are counter-productive, they are taken as promises by the client when they can never be right
- Trying to make better estimates is a fool's errand, which will take up time that could be used for doing something actually useful (that approaches you to an actual outcome)
